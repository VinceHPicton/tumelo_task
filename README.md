# tumelo_task

Please note that there are a few comments in this project which are for you guys to help understand my thinking, under normal circumstances
almost none of these would be in the code, the only ones I would leave are docstrings for functions (which are builtin Go functionality)

To be clear - I believe commenting code in general is a poor practice and with proper naming and splitting out functions it should pretty much never be necessary
